## Summary of Material Covered So Far
At this point in the course, you have seen three lessons which cover the most fundamental concepts to know for anyone in the Humanities who wants to write code in Python, as well as some basic skills which allow you to  You have also been presented with the opportunity to complete exercises to navigate the language and lightly process some data. 
Here is a list of the topics to which you have been exposed so far:

<li>What is coding and what is programming</li>
<li>How most Python programs are designed into 'Packages', 'Modules','Classes', 'Functions', 'Variables' and 'Data' </li>
<li>How to install, import, and navigate packages and modules</li>
<li>What is a code repository and how to navigate repositories and find source code</li>
<li>How to navigate Jupyter Notebooks, a common platform for building programs</li>
<li>How to declare and print variables</li>
<li>How to tell Python to read a file on your computer</li>
<li>How Python reads your data (some common data types)</li>
<li>Crucial things for anyone writing in Python to know: zero-indexing, commenting, and writing consistency</li>
<li>What are Python functions</li>
<li>What is a 'for loop'</li>

By this point you should be able to:
<li>Find Python modules, packages, and source code on the Python website and on code repositories</li>
<li>Install packages that you want to use</li>
<li>Import packages or parts of packages that you want to use</li>
<li>Easily navigate a Jupyter Notebook page, including the directory, cells, and kernel</li>
<li>Create variables that are properly named, and print them when wanted</li>
<li>Get Python to read the contents of a file in your current working directory</li>
<li>Write a variable to be of a specific data type</li>
<li>Read functions in someone's code, and write a very simple function yourself</li>
<li>Write a simple for loop that gives the expected output when run</li>

# CDH-cookbook
Welcome to the CDH Cookbook, a site with free lessons and resources for Digital Humanities technical methods.

To launch this site we have a set of [beginner lessons in Python](https://cambridgedh.github.io/CDH-cookbook/beginner/python/toc.html). But over time we plan to add more lessons and other materials.

The CDH Cookbook is put together by staff and associates of [Cambridge Digital Humanities](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/), an interdisciplinary research centre at the University of Cambridge.
